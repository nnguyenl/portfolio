              <h1>Self & Place</h1>
              <h3>project description</h3>
              <p>The purpose of this project is to use photographs to digitally
                represent yourself based on your chosen topic. My concept for this
                project is to show two contrasting photo that represents my
                “private self”, the person not everyone sees and my “public self”,
                what everyone else sees me like on social media (instagram).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
              <h1>Concept</h1>
              <p>The first photo is my private self. I planned to take this picture
                in a more quiet environment to represent mystery/privacy. I decided
                to take this picture standing in between an aisle in a public
                library while holding my laptop in front of me. By standing behind
                the laptop screen it represents my true self, the real person behind
                my social media self. I found an aisle with empty shelves on both
                sides and thought it would be best to represent loneliness/privacy
                since it’s empty. I also gave the photo a low saturation to bring
                out the greys and blacks since those colours represents mystery and
                security. The photo was shot with me standing in the middle. The
                lines from the selves lead the eye towards the centre where I was
                standing. It was also shot at eye point of view giving it more of
                a reality feel. My private self isn’t perfect as it looks through
                my social media its the reality, it isn’t as simple as it may seem
                online. It’s all the good and the bad something not everyone gets
                to see. No one would ever be able to tell who I really was just
                looking at my online persona and I decided to represent this by
                showing myself as the main subject behind a computer screen.
              <br><br>
  	             My contrasting photo, however, represents my social media self,
                 which is only the good and fun aspects in my life. I portrayed
                 this by going into a more urban/public setting. Since this photo
                 only represents the fun stuff people see through my social media
                 life, I decided to add wings to my back. The wings represent the
                 online persona I’ve created for myself, it also makes it more of
                 a imaginary not reality since everything portrayed on social
                 media isn’t always as it seems. In the photo I’m positioned more
                 towards the left with my head looking back. This photo was shot
                 at a low point of view to make me seem more powerful and in
                 control which is the power that social media lets a person have.
                 I decided to removed the buildings behind me so it would seem
                 like I was looking towards the empty white sky, something
                 unknown/imaginary . The tones for this photo is light so I used
                 the colours blue and white since they represent power, creation
                 and simple.</p>

              <p>I started out by creating two mind maps to draught down ideas
                for my photos. The first mind map is for my private self and the second
                map is for my public self. Then I took these ideas and went out with a
                friend to take some experimenting shots. After taking the experimenting
                shots, I went home and looked over them. I tried to create a concept
                using the photos I had and explored the ideas that I had in mind.
                <br><br>
                For the first photo I wanted to keep the idea of me being behind
                the computer screen to show my true private self and for the second
                photo I decided I to be in an urban area and add a photo of my
                hand holding a pencil to make it look like I’m drawing a picture
                of myself which would represents how my public social media self
                is a person I’ve created not my true self.</p>

                  </div>
                </div>

                <p>After retaking all my photos I narrowed it down to the final
                  photos that would best represent my idea. From there, I started to
                  individually edit the photos starting with the "private self" photo.
                  <br><br>
                  For the first photo, I went into image adjustment and used the
                  hue/saturation settings to lower the saturation down by -50. Next,
                  I used the quick selection tool to select the background of
                  the photo to adjust the brightness and contrast. From there, I select
                  the light on the ceiling and darken it with the lightness adjustment
                  in hue/saturation settings.
                  <br><br>
                  For the second photo, after opening the original photo in photoshop,
                  I imported the picture of the seagull and used the quick selection
                  tool to crop the bird. Then using the quick selection tool again
                  I selected only the wings/body of the bird. I copied and pasted
                  the wings to make a total of 4. Using the transformation tool
                  I began to enlarge and shape the wings to my liking and then
                  repeated the process for the rest of the wings. After placing
                  the group of wings behind my back, I used the quick selection
                  tool once again to select my whole body and the wings. Then I
                  copied and paste it onto a new layer that I’ve created, from
                  there I was able to use the cloning tool to photoshop out the
                  buildings behind me from the original photo. Finally I selected
                  the background layer and used the hue/saturation tool in image
                  adjustment to increase the saturation and turn up the lightness.

              <h1>conclusion</h1>
              <p>The outcome of this digital image design project was excellent, the
                photos come out as I planned in both the print and digital version.
                Even though the outcome of this was great, I believe the photos can
                still be further refined to produce an even better result especially
                the wings in the second photo.
