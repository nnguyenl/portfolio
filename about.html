        <p>I am Newton Nguyen-Le, a photographer and design student in
          Vancouver, BC. I am currently studying at the School of Interactive
          Art & Technology at Simon Fraser University.
          <br><br>
          Through my passion for photography and design, I can express my
          creative side and share my experiences with the world.
          <br><br>
          My photography seeks to capture the different qualities and personalities
          of a person and all the beautiful and memorable experiences I encounter
          in life. As a design student, I aim to create work that will
          visually enhance other's experiences. I am interested in work that
          allows me to share my experiences to further grow as a person and
          as an artist.</p>
