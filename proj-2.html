              <h1>Beloved: 3-in-1 Book Covers</h1>
              <h3>project description</h3>
              <p>Redesign the cover of an existing book for three different audiences
                and three distinct genres. The goal of this project is to explore
                different design decisions associated with book genres and audiences
                by developing concepts and typographic format for each of the book
                cover. Deliverable should also include a one-page rationale including
                original research.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
              <h1>Design Rationale</h1>
              <p>My main approach for the first cover was to target adults, mostly
                African-Americans and older audiences who are interested in historical
                literature. I graphically designed this cover to be simple, clean, and
                aesthetically pleasing so readers can be proud and not afraid to show
                off the book when reading it in public. The silhouette of the
                African-American woman on the cover gives the audience a peak into
                the novel, the hat helps set a sense of time/place while the rose
                and blood gives a hint into the meaning behind “Beloved”. The serif
                typeface chosen for the title was Benguiat Pro ITC to give the book
                a high-end stylistic feel while maintaining the historical element
                to the overall design. The title typeface was paired with a more
                traditional serif to give balance to the overall composition of
                the book.
                <br><br>
                My targeted audience for the second cover was graphically designed
                for children under six years old. Keeping the main themes of the book,
                I decided to design a ghost story. I drew an African-American kid
                wearing a ghost costume standing in a hay field to represent a form
                of farm life and give an element of slavery. My goal was to keep the
                book more light and playful. I was able to achieve this by using a
                spooky yet playful typeface combined with happy colour elements.
                The colours red, pink, blue and yellow used in the three covers were
                all selected because of its significants in the novel. Red was a
                symbol of pain, evil and death, representing blood from the death of
                the child. Pink is the last colour the mother remembers seeing on her
                baby’s headstone, the colour was incorporated into the rose of the
                first cover. Finally,blue and yellow were used to signify peace in
                the novel.
                <br><br>
                My targeted audience for the final cover were teenagers and/or
                high school readers. I based this design on the genre of magical
                realism. My approach to this cover was inspired by the book series,
                Twilight. I wanted it to be more imaged based, dark and stylish to
                better fit into the theme of teenage novels. I chose an image of a
                rose with chains to represent the significants of the female
                characters and themes of slavery and freedom. The typeface I chose
                for the title was Carilliantine Solid, since it gives character to
                story but also a stylistic approach you often see a lot in similar
                book genres. I used a serif typeface for the authors name to help
                with type hierarchy and paired the two fonts with Avenir Next to keep
                everything balance and legible.</p>

              <p>I started out by creating two mind maps to draught down ideas
                for my photos. The first mind map is for my private self and the second
                map is for my public self. Then I took these ideas and went out with a
                friend to take some experimenting shots. After taking the experimenting
                shots, I went home and looked over them. I tried to create a concept
                using the photos I had and explored the ideas that I had in mind.
                <br><br>
                For the first photo I wanted to keep the idea of me being behind
                the computer screen to show my true private self and for the second
                photo I decided I to be in an urban area and add a photo of my
                hand holding a pencil to make it look like I’m drawing a picture
                of myself which would represents how my public social media self
                is a person I’ve created not my true self.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
              <h3>photo selection</h3>

                <div class="proj-imgprocess">
                  <div class="proj-imgbox">
                    <img src="img/SP-3.png" alt="brainstorming" class="proj-imgprocess">

                  <div class="proj-imgbox">

                  </div>
                </div>

                <p>After retaking all my photos I narrowed it down to the final
                  photos that would best represent my idea. From there, I started to
                  individually edit the photos starting with the "private self" photo.
                  <br><br>
                  For the first photo, I went into image adjustment and used the
                  hue/saturation settings to lower the saturation down by -50. Next,
                  I used the quick selection tool to select the background of
                  the photo to adjust the brightness and contrast. From there, I select
                  the light on the ceiling and darken it with the lightness adjustment
                  in hue/saturation settings.
                  <br><br>
                  For the second photo, after opening the original photo in photoshop,
                  I imported the picture of the seagull and used the quick selection
                  tool to crop the bird. Then using the quick selection tool again
                  I selected only the wings/body of the bird. I copied and pasted
                  the wings to make a total of 4. Using the transformation tool
                  I began to enlarge and shape the wings to my liking and then
                  repeated the process for the rest of the wings. After placing
                  the group of wings behind my back, I used the quick selection
                  tool once again to select my whole body and the wings. Then I
                  copied and paste it onto a new layer that I’ve created, from
                  there I was able to use the cloning tool to photoshop out the
                  buildings behind me from the original photo. Finally I selected
                  the background layer and used the hue/saturation tool in image
                  adjustment to increase the saturation and turn up the lightness.

              <h3>conclusion</h3>
              <p>The outcome of this digital image design project was excellent, the
                photos come out as I planned in both the print and digital version.
                Even though the outcome of this was great, I believe the photos can
                still be further refined to produce an even better result especially
                the wings in the second photo.
