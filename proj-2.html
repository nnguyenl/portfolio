              <h1>Beloved: 3-in-1 Book Covers</h1>
              <h3>project description</h3>
              <p>Redesign the cover of an existing book for three different audiences
                and three distinct genres. The goal of this project is to explore
                different design decisions associated with book genres and audiences
                by developing concepts and typographic format for each of the book
                cover. Deliverable should also include a one-page rationale including
                original research.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
              <h1>Design Rationale</h1>
              <p>My main approach for the first cover was to target adults, mostly
                African-Americans and older audiences who are interested in historical
                literature. I graphically designed this cover to be simple, clean, and
                aesthetically pleasing so readers can be proud and not afraid to show
                off the book when reading it in public. The silhouette of the
                African-American woman on the cover gives the audience a peak into
                the novel, the hat helps set a sense of time/place while the rose
                and blood gives a hint into the meaning behind “Beloved”. The serif
                typeface chosen for the title was Benguiat Pro ITC to give the book
                a high-end stylistic feel while maintaining the historical element
                to the overall design. The title typeface was paired with a more
                traditional serif to give balance to the overall composition of
                the book.
                <br><br>
                My targeted audience for the second cover was graphically designed
                for children under six years old. Keeping the main themes of the book,
                I decided to design a ghost story. I drew an African-American kid
                wearing a ghost costume standing in a hay field to represent a form
                of farm life and give an element of slavery. My goal was to keep the
                book more light and playful. I was able to achieve this by using a
                spooky yet playful typeface combined with happy colour elements.
                The colours red, pink, blue and yellow used in the three covers were
                all selected because of its significants in the novel. Red was a
                symbol of pain, evil and death, representing blood from the death of
                the child. Pink is the last colour the mother remembers seeing on her
                baby’s headstone, the colour was incorporated into the rose of the
                first cover. Finally,blue and yellow were used to signify peace in
                the novel.
                <br><br>
                My targeted audience for the final cover were teenagers and/or
                high school readers. I based this design on the genre of magical
                realism. My approach to this cover was inspired by the book series,
                Twilight. I wanted it to be more imaged based, dark and stylish to
                better fit into the theme of teenage novels. I chose an image of a
                rose with chains to represent the significants of the female
                characters and themes of slavery and freedom. The typeface I chose
                for the title was Carilliantine Solid, since it gives character to
                story but also a stylistic approach you often see a lot in similar
                book genres. I used a serif typeface for the authors name to help
                with type hierarchy and paired the two fonts with Avenir Next to keep
                everything balance and legible.</p>

                <p>The Braided Hair (image) was used in cover #1. The original image
                  of the braided hair has been image traced and modified. The length
                  and style of the braid has been edited. An effect was also added
                  to the stroke to create a more textured look. Other graphics on
                  the cover were all original drawn artworks.
                  <br><br>
                  Rose & Chain was used in cover #2. The original image has was
                  first photoshopped to remove watermarks and elements including
                  background, extra rose leaves, and other imperfections. The image
                  was then traced and modified to create the final look used in the
                  teen’s book cover.
                  <br><br>
                  The Hay Field (image) was used in cover #3. The original image has
                  been modified with a “cutout” style effect added onto the photo to
                  create a drawing or sketched like image. Image was used twice.

              <h3>conclusion</h3>
              <p>The outcome of this graphic design publishing project was great, the
                covers were designed as intended in both the print and digital version.
                I believe the that the covers can still be further refined to produce
                an even better outcome especially covers 2 and 3. I believe I could better
                design a cover that would more suitably fit the intended audiences</p>
